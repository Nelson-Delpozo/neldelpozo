# Product Context: Personal Portfolio Website

## 1. Problem Statement
Nelson Delpozo needs a professional online presence to showcase his web development skills and projects. Without a dedicated portfolio site, it's harder to present his work cohesively to potential employers, clients, or collaborators.

## 2. Solution
A modern and elegant personal portfolio website built with Remix. This site will serve as a central hub for Nelson's professional identity, featuring:
- A curated selection of his best web projects.
- Clear descriptions and links to live versions of these projects.
- An easy way for interested parties to contact him.
- A reflection of his personal brand and technical capabilities.

## 3. How It Should Work
The website should be a single-page application or a very simple multi-page application that is fast, responsive, and easy to navigate.

- **Landing/Homepage:**
    - Immediately capture attention with a strong headline or personal statement.
    - Briefly introduce Nelson and his core skills.
    - Smooth navigation to other sections (Projects, Contact, About).
- **Projects Section:**
    - Each project should be presented clearly, possibly in a card-based layout.
    - For each project:
        - Title
        - Concise description highlighting key features and technologies used.
        - Link to the live project.
        - A visual preview (screenshot or potentially an iframe if feasible and performant).
- **Contact Section:**
    - A simple and user-friendly contact form.
    - Fields: Name, Email, Message.
    - Upon submission, the form data should be sent as an email to Nelson's specified email address via Sendgrid.
    - Clear feedback to the user upon successful submission or if an error occurs.
- **About Section (Recommended):**
    - A brief biography of Nelson.
    - An area to list key skills, technologies, and perhaps experience.
    - The `Nelson-Delpozo.jpeg` image could be featured here.

## 4. User Experience (UX) Goals
- **Modern & Elegant:** The design should be contemporary, clean, and visually appealing, reflecting professionalism.
- **Intuitive Navigation:** Users should easily find information about Nelson and his projects.
- **Fast & Responsive:** The site must load quickly and adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Clear Call to Actions:** Guide users towards viewing projects or making contact.
- **Trustworthy & Professional:** The overall experience should instill confidence in Nelson's abilities.

## 5. Key Success Factors
- Positive first impression on visitors.
- Effective showcase of Nelson's projects and skills.
- Reliable and functional contact mechanism.
- The site accurately represents Nelson's personal brand.
