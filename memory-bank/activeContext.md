# Active Context: Personal Portfolio Website

## 1. Current Work Focus
- Addressed Vercel deployment error related to Prisma Client initialization.
- Awaiting user confirmation that the fix works and testing of the contact form.

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions
- **Phase 1-4 Completed (Implementation & Fixes):**
    - Contact form and Sendgrid integration implemented.
    - Build fix for Sendgrid client-side dependencies in `remix.config.js`.
- **Vercel Deployment Fix:**
    - Deleted `app/db.server.ts` and `app/singleton.server.ts` (Prisma Client setup files).
    - Updated `app/routes/healthcheck.tsx` to remove Prisma dependency and only check app responsiveness.
- **Project Goal:** Create a "digital business card" style website, single-page, with a dark, minimalist theme.
- **Design Theme:** Dark, minimalist.

## 3. Next Steps
1.  **User Deployment & Testing:**
    *   User to redeploy to Vercel to confirm the Prisma runtime error is resolved.
    *   User to ensure `.env` file is correctly configured on Vercel with Sendgrid credentials.
    *   User to thoroughly test the contact form on the deployed Vercel site.
2.  **Proceed to Phase 5 (Navbar/Footer & Polish):** Upon user confirmation that the deployment error is fixed and the contact form works correctly.
3.  **Update `progress.md`** after user verification.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations
- Removing Prisma setup entirely is the cleanest way to resolve the error for a no-DB project.
- Health check now only verifies app responsiveness, not DB connectivity.

## 5. Open Questions for User
- Confirmation that the Vercel deployment error is resolved.
- Confirmation that the contact form works as expected on Vercel after configuring environment variables there.
