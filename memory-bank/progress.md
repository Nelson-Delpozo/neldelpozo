# Progress: Personal Portfolio Website

## 1. Current Status
- **Phase:** Phase 2 (Hero Section) Completed.
- **Overall Progress:** 40% (Hero section implemented with bio and image).

## 2. What Works
- Core Memory Bank files are up-to-date.
- Project is significantly simplified (Phase 1).
- Default dark theme is configured and applied.
- `app/components/Hero.tsx` is created and displays:
    - Name, title, and bio.
    - `Nelson-Delpozo.jpeg` image.
    - Styled with a dark, minimalist aesthetic.
- `app/routes/_index.tsx` renders the Hero section and has placeholders for Projects and Contact sections.

## 3. What's Left to Build (High-Level for Digital Business Card)
- **Portfolio Structure & Layout (`app/routes/_index.tsx`):**
    - Implement Projects section (Phase 3).
    - Implement Contact section (Phase 4).
    - Simple Navigation (Phase 5, optional).
- **Components:**
    - `ProjectCard.tsx` (Phase 3)
    - `ContactForm.tsx` (Phase 4)
    - Minimal `Navbar.tsx` / `Footer.tsx` (Phase 5, optional)
- **Functionality:**
    - Sendgrid integration for the contact form (Phase 4).
    - Responsive design implementation (ongoing).
- **Styling:**
    - Detailed implementation of the dark, minimalist theme for remaining components (ongoing).
- **Content Integration:**
    - Populate SmartLynx project details (title, description, link, user-provided screenshot) into `ProjectCard.tsx` (Phase 3).
- **Environment Setup:**
    - Install `@sendgrid/mail` (Phase 4).
    - Update `.env.example` for Sendgrid (Phase 4).

## 4. Known Issues & Blockers
- **Sendgrid API Key:** User to provide and configure in `.env` during Phase 4.
- **SmartLynx Screenshot:** User to provide image file for Phase 3.

## 5. Next Immediate Milestones
1.  **User Verification of Phase 2:** User to run `npm run dev` (or refresh) and confirm the Hero section looks good.
2.  **Proceed to Phase 3 (Project Section):** Upon user confirmation.
    *   Develop `app/components/ProjectCard.tsx`.
    *   Integrate SmartLynx details.
    *   Style according to dark, minimalist theme.
