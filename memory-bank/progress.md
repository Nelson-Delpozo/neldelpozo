# Progress: Personal Portfolio Website

## 1. Current Status
- **Phase:** Phase 1 (Cleanup & Basic Structure) Completed.
- **Overall Progress:** 25% (Indie Stack cleaned up, basic dark theme and file structure established).

## 2. What Works
- Core Memory Bank files are up-to-date.
- Project is significantly simplified:
    - Unused routes and models removed.
    - Prisma schema cleaned.
    - Session management code removed.
- Default dark theme is configured in `app/root.tsx` and `tailwind.config.ts`.
- `app/components/` and `public/img/` directories are created.
- `public/img/Nelson-Delpozo.jpeg` is in place.
- A placeholder `app/routes/_index.tsx` demonstrates the basic setup.

## 3. What's Left to Build (High-Level for Digital Business Card)
- **Portfolio Structure & Layout (`app/routes/_index.tsx`):**
    - Implement actual sections: Hero/Intro, Projects (SmartLynx), Contact.
    - Simple Navigation (if needed).
- **Components:**
    - `Hero.tsx` (Phase 2)
    - `ProjectCard.tsx` (Phase 3)
    - `ContactForm.tsx` (Phase 4)
    - Minimal `Navbar.tsx` / `Footer.tsx` (Phase 5, optional)
- **Functionality:**
    - Sendgrid integration for the contact form (Phase 4).
    - Responsive design implementation (ongoing).
- **Styling:**
    - Detailed implementation of the dark, minimalist theme for all components (ongoing).
- **Content Integration:**
    - Populate SmartLynx project details (title, description, link, user-provided screenshot) (Phase 3).
    - Integrate bio and `Nelson-Delpozo.jpeg` into Hero component (Phase 2).
- **Environment Setup:**
    - Install `@sendgrid/mail` (Phase 4).
    - Update `.env.example` for Sendgrid (Phase 4).

## 4. Known Issues & Blockers
- **Sendgrid API Key:** User to provide and configure in `.env` during Phase 4.
- **SmartLynx Screenshot:** User to provide image file for Phase 3.

## 5. Next Immediate Milestones
1.  **User Verification of Phase 1:** User to run `npm run dev` and confirm the placeholder page works as expected (dark theme, basic content).
2.  **Proceed to Phase 2 (Hero Section):** Upon user confirmation.
    *   Develop `app/components/Hero.tsx`.
    *   Integrate bio and image.
    *   Style according to dark, minimalist theme.
