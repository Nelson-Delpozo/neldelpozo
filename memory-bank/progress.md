# Progress: Personal Portfolio Website

## 1. Current Status
- **Phase:** Phase 4 (Contact Form & Sendgrid) Implementation Completed, including build fix.
- **Overall Progress:** 80% (Contact form UI, backend logic, and build configuration fixed).

## 2. What Works
- Core Memory Bank files are up-to-date.
- Phases 1-3 (Cleanup, Hero Section, Project Section with image) are complete.
- `@sendgrid/mail` package installed.
- `.env.example` updated with Sendgrid configuration placeholders.
- `app/components/ContactForm.tsx` created.
- `app/routes/_index.tsx` has an `action` function for form processing.
- `ContactForm` component is integrated.
- `remix.config.js` updated to polyfill `fs` and `path` for browser compatibility with Sendgrid helpers, resolving build issues.

## 3. What's Left to Build (High-Level for Digital Business Card)
- **User Configuration & Testing:**
    - User needs to set up their `.env` file with Sendgrid API key and verified sender email.
    - User needs to test form submission thoroughly.
- **Portfolio Structure & Layout (`app/routes/_index.tsx`):**
    - Simple Navigation (Phase 5, optional).
- **Components:**
    - Minimal `Navbar.tsx` / `Footer.tsx` (Phase 5, optional)
- **Functionality:**
    - Responsive design implementation (ongoing, final polish in Phase 5).
- **Styling:**
    - Final styling polish for all components (Phase 5).

## 4. Known Issues & Blockers
- **Sendgrid Configuration:** Contact form will not function until the user correctly configures their `.env` file with a valid Sendgrid API key and a verified sender email address.

## 5. Next Immediate Milestones
1.  **User Configuration & Testing of Contact Form:**
    *   User to set up `.env` with Sendgrid credentials.
    *   User to ensure dev server has picked up `.env` changes (restart if necessary).
    *   User to run `npm run dev` and test form submission (validation, success, failure cases) and email receipt.
2.  **Proceed to Phase 5 (Navbar/Footer & Polish):** Upon user confirmation that the contact form is working correctly.
