# Active Context: Personal Portfolio Website

## 1. Current Work Focus
- Phase 4 (Contact Form & Sendgrid) implementation complete, including build configuration fix.
- Awaiting user testing of the contact form functionality with their Sendgrid credentials.

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions
- **Phase 1-3 Completed.**
- **Phase 4 Completed (Implementation & Fix):**
    - `@sendgrid/mail` package installed.
    - `.env.example` updated.
    - `app/components/ContactForm.tsx` created.
    - `app/routes/_index.tsx` updated with `action` function and `ContactForm` integration.
    - **Build Fix:** Updated `remix.config.js` to include `browserNodeBuiltinsPolyfill: { modules: { fs: true, path: true } }` to resolve build errors related to Sendgrid's client-side usage of Node built-ins.
- **Project Goal:** Create a "digital business card" style website, single-page, with a dark, minimalist theme.
- **Design Theme:** Dark, minimalist.

## 3. Next Steps
1.  **User Configuration & Testing (CRITICAL):**
    *   User to ensure `.env` file is correctly configured with `SENDGRID_API_KEY` and verified `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL`.
    *   User to ensure dev server has picked up `.env` changes (restart if necessary).
    *   User to thoroughly test the contact form (validation, success, failure, email receipt).
2.  **Proceed to Phase 5 (Navbar/Footer & Polish):** Upon user confirmation that the contact form works correctly.
3.  **Update `progress.md`** after user verification.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations
- The contact form relies on environment variables for Sendgrid credentials.
- The build issue with Sendgrid client-side dependencies is resolved.

## 5. Open Questions for User
- Confirmation that the contact form works as expected after configuring `.env` and testing.
