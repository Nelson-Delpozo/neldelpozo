# Progress: Personal Portfolio Website

## 1. Current Status
- **Phase:** Phase 3 (Project Section) Completed, including image integration.
- **Overall Progress:** 60% (Project card for SmartLynx implemented with screenshot).

## 2. What Works
- Core Memory Bank files are up-to-date.
- Project is significantly simplified (Phase 1).
- Default dark theme is configured and applied.
- Hero section is implemented (Phase 2).
- `app/components/ProjectCard.tsx` is created and displays SmartLynx project details:
    - Title, description, and link to live site (opens in new tab).
    - Project screenshot (`smartlynx-preview.png`) is now displayed.
    - Styled with a dark, minimalist aesthetic.
- `app/routes/_index.tsx` renders the Hero and Project sections correctly.
- Image filename issue resolved by renaming to a web-friendly format.

## 3. What's Left to Build (High-Level for Digital Business Card)
- **Portfolio Structure & Layout (`app/routes/_index.tsx`):**
    - Implement Contact section (Phase 4).
    - Simple Navigation (Phase 5, optional).
- **Components:**
    - `ContactForm.tsx` (Phase 4)
    - Minimal `Navbar.tsx` / `Footer.tsx` (Phase 5, optional)
- **Functionality:**
    - Sendgrid integration for the contact form (Phase 4).
    - Responsive design implementation (ongoing).
- **Styling:**
    - Detailed implementation of the dark, minimalist theme for remaining components (ongoing).
- **Environment Setup:**
    - Install `@sendgrid/mail` (Phase 4).
    - Update `.env.example` for Sendgrid (Phase 4).

## 4. Known Issues & Blockers
- **Sendgrid API Key:** User to provide and configure in `.env` during Phase 4.

## 5. Next Immediate Milestones
1.  **User Verification of Phase 3 (with image):** User to run `npm run dev` (or refresh) and confirm the Project section (with SmartLynx card and screenshot) looks good.
2.  **Proceed to Phase 4 (Contact Form & Sendgrid):** Upon user confirmation.
    *   Install `@sendgrid/mail`.
    *   Update `.env.example`.
    *   Develop `app/components/ContactForm.tsx`.
    *   Implement Remix `action` for form submission.
