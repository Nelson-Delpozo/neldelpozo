# Active Context: Personal Portfolio Website

## 1. Current Work Focus
- Phase 2 (Hero Section) has been completed.
- Awaiting user feedback or instruction to proceed with Phase 3 (Project Section).

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions
- **Phase 1 Completed:** Cleanup and basic structure.
- **Phase 2 Completed:**
    - `app/components/Hero.tsx` created:
        - Displays name, title ("Software & Web Developer").
        - Integrates bio: "Software and web developer with ten years experience..."
        - Includes image `/img/Nelson-Delpozo.jpeg`.
        - Styled with a dark, minimalist aesthetic using Tailwind CSS.
    - `app/routes/_index.tsx` updated:
        - Imports and renders the `Hero` component.
        - Includes styled placeholders for "Projects" and "Contact" sections.
        - Main page background set to `bg-gray-900`.
- **Project Goal:** Create a "digital business card" style website, single-page, with a dark, minimalist theme.
- **Design Theme:** Dark, minimalist.

## 3. Next Steps
1.  **User Verification:** User to run `npm run dev` (if not already running) or refresh the browser to check the new Hero section.
2.  **Proceed to Phase 3 (Project Section):** Upon user confirmation/request. This involves:
    *   Developing `app/components/ProjectCard.tsx`.
    *   Integrating SmartLynx project details (title, description, link, placeholder for screenshot).
    *   Styling for the dark, minimalist theme.
    *   Updating `app/routes/_index.tsx` to use the `ProjectCard` component within the Projects section.
3.  **Update `progress.md`** after user verification.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations
- Continue with the phased development plan.
- Ensure consistency in the dark, minimalist theme across all sections.

## 5. Open Questions for User
- Confirmation that Phase 2 (Hero Section) looks good and functions as expected.
- Reminder to provide the screenshot for SmartLynx when we reach Phase 3 implementation.
